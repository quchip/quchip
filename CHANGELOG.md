This file records notable user-visible changes to quchip.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Highlights

- Inspect authored and solver-resolved physics as backend-neutral symbolic expressions without forcing numerical materialization.
- Choose explicit Fock, charge, phase-grid, or custom local spaces, with native or energy-eigenstate solver bases.
- Reuse sparse operators, compiled batches, and resolved chip contracts while tracking construction and solve performance in CI.

### Physics and modelling

- Added `PhysicsExpr` for symbolic parameters, matrices, time-dependent scalars, labels, and opaque JAX callables. Expressions support semantic display, immutable parameter rebinding, and explicit `.matrix()` materialization. [#4]
- Added `LocalSpace`, `FockSpace`, `ChargeSpace`, `PhaseGridSpace`, and `CustomSpace`. A chip or individual device can use its authored native basis or project into a retained local energy basis with `projection_levels`. [#6]
- Basis resolution now transforms Hamiltonians, couplings, drives, pumps, states, observables, collapse operators, frames, and RWA bands through one engine-owned boundary. Native solving remains the default. [#6]
- Added distinct inspection paths: `unresolved_hamiltonian()` preserves authored static physics, while `hamiltonian()` reports the canonical result after basis, frame, and RWA resolution. Sequence Hamiltonians also include scheduled drives. [#6]
- Added concise declarative surfaces for custom devices, couplings, component-owned time dependence, drive operators, envelopes, scalar time coefficients, local dissipation, custom spaces, and interop mappings. Installed references exercise each supported path. [#10]

### Engine and performance

- Replaced the previous Hamiltonian containers with the frozen `EngineResult`, `SolveProblem`, and `SolveBatch` contracts shared by QuTiP and dynamiqs. [#4]
- Preserved sparse canonical operators through assembly, compiled native batches once, avoided unnecessary result densification, and selected compact dynamiqs storage. [#6]
- Reused resolved engine assembly and chip snapshots when their physics inputs are unchanged, including the common state-preparation and sequence-build path. [#8]
- Added reproducible QuTiP and dynamiqs benchmark CI with separate cold-build, repeated-build, first-solve, and warm-solve measurements, physics-parity checks, environment receipts, and raw samples. Timing changes remain informational. [#7]

### Developer tooling and CI

- Added per-Python CI constraint files and a weekly unconstrained dependency canary. Published package metadata remains unpinned. [#3]
- Added a format-aware prose audit for Python docstrings, Markdown, and rendered HTML. It reports recognizable patterns and coverage without guessing authorship. [#9]
- Added a pull-request template covering verification, documentation, paired notebooks, `PHYSICS.md`, and AI-assistance disclosure. [#9]
- Generated constructor stubs now cover declarative devices, couplings, and parameterized drives. [#10]

### Documentation

- Updated the README, physics reference, cookbook, API docstrings, documentation home, and executed hello-chip example for symbolic inspection, local spaces, basis projection, and authored versus resolved Hamiltonians. [#9]
- Kept the hello-chip plots unchanged after clean execution, receipt checks, strict Jupytext pairing, and image comparison. [#9]

### Compatibility and migration

- Replace `HamiltonianDescription` with `EngineResult`, `build_hamiltonian_description()` with `build_engine_result()`, and `SolveProblem.hamiltonian` with `SolveProblem.engine_result`.
- Replace `ProblemBatch` and `BatchedHamiltonianDescription` with `SolveBatch` and the `QuantumSequence` batch APIs.
- `CircuitDevice` is no longer public. Custom devices should declare an explicit `LocalSpace` through `BaseDevice` or `FockDevice`, as appropriate; built-in charge-basis and phase-grid devices use the same boundary.
- Declarative methods receive the symbolic parameter namespace `p`. Custom models use `local_hamiltonian(op, p)`, `interaction(a, b, p)`, and `time_terms(...)` returning `TimeDependentTerm` values.
- Devices, drives, couplings, and baths declare loss through `dissipation(...)`, returning `CollapseChannel` values with unscaled operators and rates in inverse nanoseconds.
- Advanced control contracts such as `BaseDrive`, `DriveModulation`, `DriveSignalSpec`, and `SignalTransform` remain available from `quchip.control` but are no longer re-exported from the top-level package.
- Use `chip.unresolved_hamiltonian()` when authored lab-frame physics is required. `chip.hamiltonian()` now returns the resolved basis/frame/RWA view used by the engine.
- Required CI currently constrains `qutip<5.3.1` because scqubits 4.3.1 and earlier cannot consume the SciPy sparse arrays returned by qutip 5.3.1. This is a CI compatibility constraint, not a package dependency pin. [#3]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added the executed [Hello, drive and readout] example, its reader-facing walkthrough, and a cookbook for executable quchip studies. [#1]
- Added `CITATION.cff` with the accompanying paper as the preferred citation.
- Published the API and physics documentation at [docs.quchip.org].

### Fixed

- Heterogeneous QuTiP problem lists now use the loky process pool while preserving input order. [#2]
- Aligned the physics reference with the implementation and widened one physics-sentinel symmetry bound to a platform-independent solver-accuracy floor.

### Packaging and infrastructure

- Added PyPI trusted publishing for version tags, project links, Python 3.11/3.12 pull-request checks, and scheduled full-suite CI.
- Served README figures from quchip.org so they render consistently on GitHub and PyPI.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

- Initial public release of the open-source Python toolkit for modelling superconducting quantum chips.
- Included device, coupling, control, frame, RWA, dissipation, transformation, sweep, visualization, and inverse-design APIs; QuTiP and dynamiqs backends; and JAX-compatible differentiation paths.
- Published the README, contribution guide, code of conduct, physics reference, and test suite.
